# Hello
some DSA project

# What is `tensors-test.zip` and `the_words.csv`?

`tensors-test.zip` is a folder containing the wiki word count for 5,000 currently-scraped characters. Each file contains a dictionary (represented in .csv)
that contains the word-id first, then the number of occurences second.
The ids of all the encountered words are located in `the_words.csv`
