# Hello
Welcome to Ship.io, a DSA project.

! NOTICE : I have gotten word of issues that stem from attempting to build the project in Godot.
This is mainly due to texture dependency issues (that should be resolved but aren't even though all of the textures we used are there).


# What are `tensors-test.zip` and `the_words.csv`?

`tensors-test.zip` is a folder containing the wiki word count for 5,000 characters. Each file contains a dictionary (represented in .csv)
that contains the word-id first, then the number of occurences second.
The ids of all the encountered words are located in `the_words.csv` 

# What is `tensors-preprocess.zip`

`tensors-preprocess.zip` is a folder that contains the word counts for all characters in the dataset.
