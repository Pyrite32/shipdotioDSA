# Hello
Welcome to Ship.io, a DSA project.

# What are `tensors-test.zip` and `the_words.csv`?

`tensors-test.zip` is a folder containing the wiki word count for 5,000 characters. Each file contains a dictionary (represented in .csv)
that contains the word-id first, then the number of occurences second.
The ids of all the encountered words are located in `the_words.csv` 

# What is `tensors-preprocess.zip`

`tensors-preprocess.zip` is a folder that contains the word counts for all characters in the dataset.
